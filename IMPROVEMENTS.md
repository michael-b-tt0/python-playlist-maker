## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Refactor `scan_library` Method**: Break down the large `scan_library` method in `LibraryService` into smaller, single-responsibility private methods (e.g., for fetching filesystem tracks, pruning the DB, synchronizing changes) to reduce complexity and improve readability.
- [ ] **Type Hints**: Complete type annotation coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: API documentation with Sphinx
- [ ] **Code Coverage**: Achieve >90% test coverage
- [ ] **Linting**: Add pre-commit hooks with black, flake8, mypy
- [ ] **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

### Architecture
- [ ] **Consolidate Configuration Logic**: Refactor the scattered configuration logic from `app.py` into `config/manager.py`. Create a single function or class to handle the hierarchy (CLI args > config file > defaults) to improve maintainability and adhere to the DRY principle.
- [ ] **Decouple Core Services from UI**: Remove direct `print()` calls from core services like `LibraryService`. Use the `logging` module for informational messages and implement a callback system for progress updates to better separate core logic from the UI.
- [ ] **Centralize Path Management**: Create a dedicated utility or class to handle all path resolutions (e.g., `os.path.expanduser`, `Path.resolve()`) at startup. This ensures all paths are absolute and validated early, preventing inconsistencies.
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Modular architecture for custom matching algorithms
- [ ] **Event System**: Pub/sub pattern for loose coupling
- [ ] **Configuration UI**: GUI for editing configuration files
- [ ] **Logging Dashboard**: Web-based log viewing and analysis
- [ ] **Metrics Collection**: Application performance monitoring

### Database & Storage
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Version-controlled schema changes
- [ ] **Backup System**: Automated database backup and restore
- [ ] **Data Export**: Export library data to various formats
- [ ] **Cloud Sync**: Synchronize library cache across devices
- [ ] **Compression**: Compress cache database for storage efficiency
